Shirley finally got her wish to visualize something from the Harry Potter franchise, and looked into the most popular ships in fanfiction.  And our guest Nicholas created fireworks for every Scrabble game he played with his family in 2013 - and he did it in only (one year and) three days!

			<p>With the Obama's leaving the white house soon Shirley investigated the emotions displayed in their tv-appearances to give the elections a bit of fun. In Europe, on the other hand, a presidential family is more equivalent to the Royal houses. Therefore, Nadieh investigated the family trees and how connected the current royal leaders really are.
